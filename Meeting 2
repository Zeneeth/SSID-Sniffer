10/08/2020 – 17:00 (Audio Call)

Meeting – Tilly, Anna, Matt, Margaret, Katie, Russell

Before: Anna and Tilly did some research and added to Git

Content:

-	Look through research everyone has done – Margaret shared another research link which has been added to 'Good Links' on Git
-	Analyse code already present that achieves all or part of our project goal.
-	Find the best way to go about our project
-	Revisit plan and described it in more detail:
  o	Build demo SSID sniffer
  o	Map the locations of Aps
    	Make it look aesthetically pleasing
    	Matt came up with the idea to research Google APIs
    	Margaret suggested that we also include a timeline as mentioned in the brief – timeline of SSID pings
  o	Make it GDPR compliant
    	Maybe get users to sign contracts/Terms and Conditions
  o	Tell people how to keep it in safe mode
-	Katie and Anna had to head off
-	Matt tested the pycapy library on the raspberry pi
-	Matt successfully managed to import and run it.
-	Margaret, Tilly, Matt and Russell agreed using python and the Pycapy library was the best step forward.

Tasks before next meeting:
-	Tilly, Margaret, Matt and Russell to learn Pycapy library and how to extract relevant information from the output by Wednesday for a coding meeting
-	Anna, Shurjo and Katie need to look into Google Maps APIs and how we can utilise them to graphically present our SSID findings. They must also look at how to create a timeline as another format of output – to show all the SSIDs by next Monday’s meetings
-	If anyone has extra time – please add some GDPR research to Github

Next Meeting:
-	Wednesday – Tilly, Margaret, Russell and Matt
-	Monday - All
